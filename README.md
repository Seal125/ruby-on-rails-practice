## Installing Ruby

This will be shown for macOS, if you plan to install it on another OS you can look at the guide at [Ruby's offical site](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)

- Open your terminal, then type `ruby -v` to check the version you have. It's likely that you already have Ruby installed in your computer.

- If you don't have it, or would like the latest version of Ruby, you can use homebrew: `brew install ruby`

- Congrats, now you have Ruby :)
