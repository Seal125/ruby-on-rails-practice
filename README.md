## Installing Ruby

This will be shown for macOS, so if you plan to install it on another OS, you can look at the installation guide at [Ruby's offical documentation](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).

- Open your terminal, then type `ruby -v` to check the version you have. It's likely that you already have Ruby installed in your computer.

- If you don't have it, or would like the latest version of Ruby, you can use homebrew: `brew install ruby`.

- Optionally (I say this because it was honestly a pain to get, but seems worth it), you can also install a version manager for Ruby, like [RVM](https://rvm.io/rvm/install), in case you need to use more than one version.

\*_This specific VM will automatically open RVM in your terminal, so if that's something you don't like, there are plenty of other ones!_

- Congrats, now you have Ruby :)

## Installing Rails

- Ensure that you're able to run `gem -v` in your terminal. This is how you use Ruby commands.

- If it's working properly, type `gem install rails` to install Rails. Also ensure it installed correctly by doing `rails -v`.

- Congrats, now you have Ruby and Rails :)

\*_For future reference, you should install rails inside your project, as it contains an app generator to quickly and easily create an app template with Rails_
