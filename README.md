## Installing Ruby

This will be shown for macOS, so if you plan to install it on another OS, you can look at the installation guide at [Ruby's offical documentation](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).

- Open your terminal, then type `ruby -v` to check the version you have. It's likely that you already have Ruby installed in your computer.

- If you don't have it, or would like the latest version of Ruby, you can use homebrew: `brew install ruby`.

- Optionally (I say this because it was honestly a pain to get, but seems worth it), you can also install a version manager for Ruby, like RVM, in case you need to use more than one version.

- Congrats, now you have Ruby :)
